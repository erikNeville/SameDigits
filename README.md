# fYou
This is the game "f*** you", with the additional rules of, Fibonacci numbers and prime numbers.

This game requires more than 2 people, up to however much you can handle.

The game works this way:

  - First person starts at "1", and the next person proceeds.

  - Order reversed means if your group is going clockwise, it's now counter-clockwise, and vice-versa.

  - If you call a number that is divisible by seven, or contains a seven, you say "Fuck You" and the order is reversed.

  - If you call a number that is a double, triple, or more (11, 22, 333, 55555, ...), you say "Fuck You" and the order
    is reversed.

  - If you call a number that is a Fibonacci Number (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...), you say "Fuck You" and the order
    is reversed.

  - If you call a prime number, you say "Fuck You", and the order is reversed.

  - If none of those conditions are true, just say the number and the order continues.

This game is intended to play with a group, and without the assistance of a computer. This program is intended to
be a cheat-sheet for each turn.
